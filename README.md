## User Story Provided 

<Br>AS A marketing agency
<Br>I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
<Br>SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria Provided 

<Br>GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
<Br>WHEN I view the source code
<Br>THEN I find semantic HTML elements
<Br>WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
<Br>THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
<Br>WHEN I view the image elements
<Br>THEN I find accessible alt attributes
<Br>WHEN I view the heading attributes
<Br>THEN they fall in sequential order
<Br>WHEN I view the title element
<Br>THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Actions Taken 

<Br>Modified code in HTML and in CSS to resolve the acceptance criteria
<Br>Updated source code in HTML to semantic elements
<Br>Ensured the elements followed a logical structure independant of styling and positioning
<Br>Added alt attributes to image elements
<Br>adjusted heading elements to fall in the correct order
<Br>Added a concise, descriptive title

## Feedback on items missed from first submission
<Br>1. The Search Engine Optimization navigation item doesn't link to the corresponding section on the page. This is because you are missing an ID on line 28 of your HTML
<Br>2. Application's CSS selectors and properties are not consolidated
<Br>3. The application's CSS file contains no comments
<Br>4. The application's HTML file contains no comments
<Br>5. Repo doesn't have a unique name. An example of a unique name would be: horiseon-accessibility-refactor

## Actions taken to correct feedback and resubmit 
<Br>1. Added the id in HTML correcting the link target
<Br>2. Consolidated the CSS selectors and properties where possible 
<Br>3. Added comments to CSS file
<Br>4. Added comments to the HTML file 
<Br>5. Created a new Repo with a more unique name and imported all data from the previous Repo 
<Br>Note:  Thank you very much for the feedback!  I really helped me to go back and make the nessasary changes for the learning experience.
